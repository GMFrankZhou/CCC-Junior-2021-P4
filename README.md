# CCC-Junior-2021-P4
Valentina wants books on a shelf to be arranged in a particular way. Every time she sees a shelf of books, she rearranges the books so that all the large books appear on the left,
followed by all the medium-sized books, and then all the small books on the right. She does this by repeatedly choosing any two books and exchanging their locations. Exchanging the locations of two books is called a swap. Help Valentina determine the fewest number of swaps needed to arrange a shelf of books as
she wishes.
